In summary, joint ICWD/LADWP line‑point transects are re‑measured annually at georeferenced locations to compare live cover and species composition to the 1984–1987 baseline and to detect measurable change over time. Methods follow the standing committee update (Feb 22, 2017) and include a consistent field protocol with annual calibration and shared data review.\n\nData Processing (ETL)\nThe annual line‑point transect data are extracted from ICWD Google Sheets and LADWP CSVs, standardized, and compiled into a single analysis‑ready dataset. The core steps are:\n\nExtract raw parcel sheets (or cached snapshots) and LADWP cover files.\n\nTransform to long format, harmonize species codes, and attach functional traits.\n\nValidate transect coverage, remove duplicates, and track entity provenance.\n\nMerge ICWD and LADWP datasets and append to the master dataset.\n\nExport long and wide deliverables for QA/QC, reporting, and archiving.\n\nIn 2025, the Inyo County Water Department (ICWD) and the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP) jointly monitored 161 vegetation parcels using 1742 line-point intercept transects. Statistical tests compared current-year vegetation cover to the 1984-1987 baseline for Wellfield parcels (pumping-affected) and Control parcels (no pumping).\nWe compare parcel-level cover in the 1984-1987 baseline (Nominal Year 1986) to the current year (2025) for Wellfield and Control parcels using the paired subset shown below. Results summarize differences in total cover, grass, and shrub cover between baseline and current-year conditions; statistical significance is shown on the plot for each cover type (ns = not significant; * indicates p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nFigure 1: Interactive Map (parcels sampled this past year)\nParcels sampled in 2025 are colored by proportional grass change (pGrass_delta = current year pGrass minus baseline pGrass).

This approach follows Green Book Section I.C.1.a, which sets out procedures for determining whether decreases in perennial cover are measurable (statistically significant).\n\nGreen Book and Baseline\n\nGreen Book\nProvides criteria for evaluating measurable vegetation changes, including the use of baseline data from 1984-1987 and statistical tests.\n1984-1987 Baseline\nLADWP inventoried and mapped vegetation across 2,126 parcels. Groundwater-dependent parcels (Types B, C, D, E) serve as focal points for assessing pumping-induced drawdown effects.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nDirection of trends (with statistical significance): Control parcel group average shows no statistically significant linear trends in cover, grass, or shrub. Wellfield parcel group average shows statistically significant increasing linear trends in cover and shrub; wellfield perennial grass shows no statistically significant trend within this subset. P-values are reported in the “Parcel Trends Over Time” section above.\nFlagged parcels: Flagged parcels indicate measurable (statistically significant) deviations from baseline. Whether these changes are attributable to pumping vs. other factors (e.g., drought, land use) are evaluated under Green Book Section I.C.1.b."
